1. load balancer helps to distribute incoming traffic to all servers and a server was adde as a redundancy incase of failure and maintenance.

2. round robin: Traffic is distribute sequentially one after the other

3. It is enabling an active-active setup: in an active-active setup, all the servers are running at a time while for the active-passive setup only one server works at a time

4. In Master-Slave cluster the the master data base store the log request and then sends it to the slave datbase which can be dine either synchronously or asynchronously

5. Writes operation are carried out by the primary node while the read operation are carried out by the replica nodes 

6. The single point of failure are area that could mae the whole system to to collapse if  they fail.

7. Having no fire wall will mean that packets will not be monitored and not having to use HTTPS means that request will not be encrypted

8. having no monitoring system means that the application and the server is not being checked in terms of performance.
